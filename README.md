# Week3-Homework1

## Description

I struggled with the decision of putting my questions fully in javascript but decided after talking to my brother it would make more sense to leave them it HTML and call them out one at a time. The other screens also appear and disapear in time with each other. Created a timer and set it to reduce time every time a question was answered incorrectly. Then created a restart button that would restart the time, while making the start button disapear. Made an alert that comes up if no text is entered in the initials area, and added a pink background. Also set up a scoreboard that will store wins and initials at the end
